ASR re-ranking using FST and WordNet

This is a implementation of my paper :

Tammewar, Aniruddha, et al. "Enhancing ASR by MT using Semantic information from Hindi WordNet." (ICON 2013).

The implementation is in a very bad shape. I will soon update this repository with cleaner code and readme for the same.

# P.S : This repository is still in development, wait for updates before you can use it
